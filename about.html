          <h3>Frontend <span>Developer</span></h3>
          <p>I am Thireesha K, a passionate front-end developer and aspiring software engineer<br> with a knack
             for creating intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences. Skilled in building <br> responsive
              websites and engaging interfaces, I bring hands-on experience in web <br> development  and UI/UX design.
               Throughout my journey, I have contributed
             to<br>  innovative projects like a music player,  e-commerce platforms, and mobile app <br> prototypes.
            Driven by a love for continuous learning, I actively participate in hackathons,<br>  competitions, 
            and internships to sharpen my skills. With proficiency in<br>  Java, Python, React.js, and modern
             design tools, I aim to leverage technology<br>  to solve real-world problems and grow as a full-stack developer.
